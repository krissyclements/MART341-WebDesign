<h3>Ingredients</h3> <bre />
<p> 6 small Bartlett, D’Anjou or Comice pears, slightly underripe </p>
<p>2 cups dry white wine </p>
<p>1 cup granulated sugar </p>
<p>¼ teaspoon crumbled saffron </p>
<p>2 thick slices of fresh ginger </p>
<p>Crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream, for serving</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3> <bre />
<p> Peel the pears, leaving stems intact. </p>
<p>Put wine, sugar, saffron and ginger in a stainless-steel saucepan or skillet just large enough to hold the pears in a single layer over high heat. Stir and bring to a boil.</p>
<p>Add pears and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook gently for about 20 minutes (turning occasionally if the pears aren’t fully submerged), until pears are just tender when poked with a skewer or a small, sharp knife. If time permits, allow pears to cool in their syrup in the refrigerator, preferably overnight or for up to several days.</p>
<p>Remove pears from syrup. Simmer syrup down to a thick glaze over brisk heat, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly (about 10 minutes) and pour over pears to serve. Pair with crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream. </p>
