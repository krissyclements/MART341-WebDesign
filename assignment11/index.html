    <h1>A House in Nebraska: Ethel Cain</h1>
    <p>Labored breaths and bed sores, sing it to me all day long
    <p>When the aching sound of silence used to be our favorite song </p>
    <p>and me against the world, you were my man and I your girl</p> 
    <p>We had nothing except each other, you were my whole world </p>
    <p>Then the day came and you were up and gone</p>
        <br>
    <p>And I still call home that house in Nebraska</p>
    <p>Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor</p>
    <p>Where the world was empty, save you and I</p>
    <p>Where you came and I laughed, and you left and I cried</p>
    <p>Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours</p>
    <br>
    <p>These dirt roads are empty, the ones we paved ourselves</p>
    <p>Your mama calls me sometimes to see if I'm doing well</p>
    <p>And I'd lie to her an say that I'm doing fine</p>
    <p>When, really, I'd kill myself to hold you one more time</p>
    <p>And it hurts to miss you, but it's worse to know</p>
    <p>That I'm the reason you won't come home</p>
    <br>
    <p>But I still call home that house in Nebraska</p>
    <p>Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor</p>
    <b>Where I needed you, and I need you still</b>
    <p>Where the world was empty, save you and I</p>
    <p>Where you came and I laughed, and you left and I cried</p>
    <p>Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours</p>
    <p>So I died there under you every night, all night</p>
    <br>
    <p>You know, I still wait at the edge of town</p>
    <p>Praying straight to God that maybe you'll come back around</p>
    <p>I cry every day and the bottles make it worse</p>
    <p>Cause you were the only one I was never scared to tell I hurt</p>
    <br>
    <p>And I found photographs of our school, on the day we met</p>
    <p>I thought that you were so beautiful, it was love, I guess</p>
    <p>But God, I just hope you're doing fine out there, I just pray that you're alright</p>
    <br>
    <p>And I feel so alone, and I feel so alone out here</p>
    <p>And I feel so alone, I'm so alone out here</p>
    <p>I feel so alone, I feel so alone</p>
    <br>
